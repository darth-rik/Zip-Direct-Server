### Custom Peerjs Server

This is a custom peerjs server built with expressJS to handle my own additional needs. The public cloud peerjs server is great for testing and familiarizing one's self with the webrtc technology. But for personal projects and especially for this project privacy is a serious issue and thus building the custom server seemed like the logical choice. The server is simple to build with only a few lines of code, with the peerjs library handling the majority of the work. But really this is just a brokering server intended to identify and connect with peers, the real magic happens in the client side, the browser.
